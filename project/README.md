    My project is a web-application to make First Aid tests.
    A person can register on the site (login, password and best results are collected in database),
can pass three difficulty level test and observe their best results. A person also can enroll themselves to pass the training.
    Those users who are marked in database as moderators have additional option to see contact data of those who register for trainings.
    As for the quiz: questions are stored in data base with difficulty level. All questions equal or below the chosen difficulty are
shuffled and passed to user to solve them.
    I also placed few easter eggs to this application. Try to find them =)
    Good luck!
